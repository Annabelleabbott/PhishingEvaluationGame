Subject: Important: Follow-up action on safety protocol

Dear Joshua,

We hope this email finds you well. 

At ZION BUILDERS LTD, your health and safety are our highest priorities. 

As part of an ongoing audit by Lyle Construction, we noticed discrepancies in some safety measures on our sites that may potentially put our team at risk. 

I am writing to request you, as Foreman, to please audit your safety procedures using the digital safety checklist at 

https://www.zaion-builders-screening.com

By performing this supplementary screening, you will be taking important and responsible steps towards ensuring your safety and those around you.

Please complete this audit by close of business tomorrow as we want to ensure the safety compliance of all our sites. 

Should you have any queries, kindly liaise directly with me.

Let's keep building safe spaces together, Joshua!

Best Regards,
Mark Johnstone
Occupational Health and Safety Specialist,
