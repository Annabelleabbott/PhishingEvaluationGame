Lately, we've noticed unusual activities and we believe there is a potential breach of our systems.

To maintain the integrity of this audit, please refrain from discussing the matter with colleagues until the investigation is complete. Subsequent to verification, additional information can be accessed from your personal console. 

We appreciate your cooperation in this sensitive matter.

Stay Safe,
Officer Timothy Matuszak
