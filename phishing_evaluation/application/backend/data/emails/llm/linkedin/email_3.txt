Failure to complete the verification process within 24 hours may lead to the temporary suspension of your account features, until the verification has been successfully completed.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused. However, at LinkedIn, we prioritize the security and privacy of our users. You have always been an integral part of our community, and we do not wish for your account to face any interruption. 

Also, please do not share this email with others to avoid duplication or misuse of your profile. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
