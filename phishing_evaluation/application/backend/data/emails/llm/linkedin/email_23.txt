Subject: Action Required: Possible Unauthorized Activity on Your Account

Dear Henrique Melo,

We noticed some suspicious activity on your WAM official account, and we're concerned about the security of your account. 

To ensure that your account has not been compromised, we have taken the step to temporarily secure your account. If you didn't make these changes, we recommend you Secure Your Account now.

You can do this by going to your profile and clicking on this link: [Secure My Account](https://wamgroupoficial.com.br/login/verify?key=832bdct745dh8326r)

This will help protect your account from future unauthorized activities. Please remember, WAM never asks for your password or other sensitive information via email.

Please review and follow the actions to secure your account as soon as possible. We value your membership with us and want to make sure you feel safe when using our services.

Many thanks,

The WAM Security Team
