From: MGM Security Department <security@mgm-resorts-international.com>

Dear Kaitlin,

As part of our regular checkup routine, we noticed some irregular activities on your MGM Resorts International administrative account.

We are not sure if it's you or someone else trying to access the system. There have been multiple login attempts from a location that isn't typical for you. As a precautionary measure, we have temporary suspended your MGM internal administrative account.

We protect all our employee's data with utmost security measures and our priority is to ensure every employee's details are safe.

To reactivate the account, we would need you to verify your identity.

Please do it instantly right here:
