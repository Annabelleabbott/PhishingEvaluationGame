Subject: Immediate Action Required: Update Your Employee Credentials for Raising Canes' Benefits!

Dear James Fisher,

We hope this email finds you well. As you are a valued team member, we are pleased to let you know about an exciting update to our benefits program. 

Raising Canes is launching a new and improved Employee Central platform designed to streamline your benefits enrollment and consolidate all our HR information in one convenient place. This includes your performance evaluations, payroll information, work schedules, and discounted online education programs. 

Before you can access these new features, all employees, including part-time and full-time staff, must reset their login credentials for security reasons. The deadline to update your credentials is the end of the day today.

Please click the following link by the end of today to reset your password. www.RaisingCanesEmployeeCentral.com/ResetPassword 

We understand you have a full day ahead between studying at Williams College and serving our awesome customers here in Portland, so we apologize for any inconvenience, but this is an urgent and mandatory security update due to recent breaches in other companies in our industry.

Your commitment to Raising Canes is highly valued, and we thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Stay safe and keep serving!

Warm Regards, 

Pamela Clark
Employee Experience Manager
Raising Canes, Portland, Oregon.
