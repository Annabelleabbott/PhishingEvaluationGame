Subject: Urgent: Required information for your prospective job role at Amentum

Dear Tien Chang,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Linda Watson, and I am the Senior HR Specialist at Amentum.

We recently received your application for the CWMD Planner role - Mid Level, based in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. We were impressed with your academic credentials from Kun Shan University and your extensive experience in the CWMD field.

During our preliminary review of applications, we found that your dedicated commitment and unique skills, particularly related to planning support, assessments, and regional expertise align perfectly with our organizational needs.

Before we proceed to the next interview phase, we've detected a small discrepancy in our records and need your urgent attention on this matter. In our effort to ensure a smooth transition for potential relocation, we require a completed copy of your US VISA and proof of resident permit details. This information is necessary to speed up the immigration processing and the administrative tasks related to it.

Please follow this link <emeniosecure.amentum.com/verify> to our secure server to upload the mentioned documents. Please forward these documents within the next 24 hours to avoid delays in your application processing.

Once we have received and confirmed your information, we will reach out to schedule your secondary interview.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter, and for considering a career at Amentum.

Best,
Linda Watson
Senior HR Specialist, Amentum
