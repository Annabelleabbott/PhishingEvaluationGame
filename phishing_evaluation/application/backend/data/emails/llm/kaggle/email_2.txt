Subject: Pine Bend Refinery - Exciting Safety Engagement Opportunity

Dear Manuel,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Foster, the Safety Culture Director at the American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP). I came across your outstanding accomplishments at Flint Hills Resources—particularly your work improving the safety culture—and I am quite impressed.

Incidentally, we're collaborating on an industry-best safety initiative with our partners in the United States. This initiative is aimed at developing comprehensive and preventive safety procedures that are planned to become industry standards, likely to be adopted by OSHA and major industrial bodies globally.

Given your achievements, and considering the parallels with Nova School of Science and Technology—known for its high-caliber safety engineering programs—we value your input and would like to invite you to be our keynote presenter. This opportunity will allow you to showcase Flint Hills Resources safety programs, your methodologies, and improvement strategies.

We have our virtual roundtable scheduled for the last week of next month. If interested, please provide your preferred time slot by clicking on the link below, and follow the steps to authenticate your identity for safety reasons.

Undoubtedly, the planned exposure could potentially benefit your future career pursuits. I will provide you further details once your availability is confirmed. 

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this prestigious stage.

Best Regards,
