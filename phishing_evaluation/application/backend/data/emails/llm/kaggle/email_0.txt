Subject: Urgent Tax Regulation Changes

Dear Martin Novak,

I hope this email finds you well. 

My name is Peter Štefanovič, and I'm the Director of Corporate Tax & Customs at the Department of Finance and Administration in Slovakia. In accordance with our records, I understand that you, Martin Novak, are currently working as a Tax Processing Specialist III in Naperville, Illinois. 

Recently, the Slovakian Legislation announced a few crucial amendments to the Slovak Tax Regulations, particularly concerning Sales and Use Tax (SUT) compliance. We believe these conventions might have significant implications for your current responsibilities as they seem to squarely align with your professional function. 

Given your integral involvement with taxation compliance and your significant experience in multi-state tax preparing software, I am reaching out to you directly with detailed insights into the recent changes to the Slovak Tax Regulations. Primarily, it's crucial to safeguard the accuracy and integrity of the SUT returns and payments you handle for your clients. 

For your convenience, I have attached a document containing a comprehensive breakdown of the modifications. It's essential to review the updates immediately as it directly impacts your daily duties. You can access the document here: www.taxes.svk/updateFeb2022

To further support you in understanding the implications of these new amendments, I would like to invite you to a virtual meeting later this week. It will be helpful for you to clarify any doubts you may have regarding this subject.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and I look forward to addressing all your queries in our meeting. 

In service,

Peter Štefanovič
