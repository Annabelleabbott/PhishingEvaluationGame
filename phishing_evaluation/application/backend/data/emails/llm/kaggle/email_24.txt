Subject: Exciting Opportunity for Nutritional Oncology Workshop

Dear Li Huan,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Henry Thomas and I serve as a Senior Scientific Officer at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital based in Memphis, TN.

I was recently visiting Xinjiang University as a guest speaker and came upon your profile in the International Student Ambassador's roster. Your dedication towards pediatrics and oncology nutrition particularly caught my eye.

Our esteemed institution, St. Jude's, which stands at the forefront of pediatric treatment and research, is hosting an exclusive webinar titled "Innovations in Pediatric Oncology Nutrition" where esteemed professionals in the field will talk about groundbreaking methods and strategies used in our treatment of pediatric cancer patients.

Having seen your interest in this field on your University's International Ambassador profile, I thought this event might benefit your academic journey. It also strikes me that you have had an eye on our organization for a prospective role as a Clinical Dietitian. This webinar could provide you with valuable insights about current practices and advancements in the field.

One of the main speakers presenting at the webinar will be Dr. Rebecca Blythe, a lead clinical dietitian in our Oncology Department. She spearheads our program in pediatric oncology nutrition and I'm certain you would greatly benefit from her expertise.
