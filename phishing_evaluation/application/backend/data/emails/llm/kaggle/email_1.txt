Subject: Urgent: Update on Job ID #3757707484 - Investor Relations Officer 

Dear Anonymous,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out from the Human Resources department at Space Ocean Corp, regarding the ongoing audit of our Investor Relations roles. We're reaching out to all employees who have recently worked, or are currently working, in either the Investor Relations Officer role (Job ID: 3757707484) or similar roles in the department.

It has come to our attention that some commission and share allocation records might not have been accurately updated in our databases due to recent system upgrades. This has led to inconsistencies that may potentially affect you, particularly if you're in a commission-based role involving company shares as compensation. A small number of employees have reported these discrepancies and we want to ensure this is rectified for all staff members.

As your job involves identifying and researching potential investors for our expansion plans, you are one of the key personnel in this department and your prompt action on this will ensure minimal disruption in your work. We are working with our IT Department to rectify this issue, and we would need your assistance to expedite the process by verifying your commission and share allocations. 

Please log into your Employee Portal at: www.spaceoceancorp.com/shareverification using your employee ID to verify your current shares. Please cross-verify this with your personal records and confirm back in the portal itself by the end of the day to avoid any ambiguity going forward.

We understand this might cause a slight inconvenience and we thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation. The organization is focused on ensuring that all our employees are fully recognized for their contributions and efforts during their tenure at Space Ocean Corp.

Best Regards,
John Smith
Chief Human Resources Officer
