Subject: IMPORTANT: University of Gezira Account Security Update 

Dear student at University of Gezira,

I hope this mail finds you in good health. This is Mohammed Salih from the university's security center. We are contacting you regarding a security concern related to your school account. There's been a recent series of attacks targeting our university's IT infrastructure. As a preliminary security measure, all student accounts have been temporarily locked. 

To resolve this, we will need to verify your identity and reset your account with a new password. This is necessary to protect your grades, enrollment status, financial aid information, and any personal information tied to your account.

Please Click on the following link [www.gezirauniportal.com/accountupdate] and provide the necessary details. Your current username, your full legal name, your birth date, and set a new password. Please, take the time to complete this action within the next three hours to avoid permanent account suspension. 

Subsequently, we encourage all students to maintain the highest level of vigilance. If you see any suspicious activity or have any concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to our dedicated university security team.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We appreciate your understanding as we work towards improving security in our university.

Best Regards,

Mohammed Salih,
