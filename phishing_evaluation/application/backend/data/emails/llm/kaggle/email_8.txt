Subject: Your Certification Renewal â€“ Urgent Action Required!

Dear Unnamed,

We hope this email finds you in good health. This message is to notify you that your Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification is scheduled to be renewed. A passing grade on the certification renewal test is required for continued practice. Failing to get recertification will make you unqualified for your current role at Life Care in accordance with the law.

Note that we are launching a new CNA Certification Portal in partnership with the Healthcare Professionals Certification Board (HPCB). All certifications will now be handled through this new portal. 

To take your certification renewal test, please click the link below:

This test is open book and you are encouraged to use all available resources to help you pass. This is the only legitimate method to keep your certification up-to-date and avoid any disruptions.

Please complete the test as soon as you can. Your certification's validity will end in 7 days if the test isn't completed.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Warm Regards,

Olga Romanova
Director, HPCB Certification Board.
