I am Jane Madsen, the Chief Operating Officer of HIRECLOUT. Our records indicate that you are one of our well-performing Business Development & Sr Tech Recruitment Associates. We value your tenacity and appreciate your efforts in recruiting top tech talent and introducing new clients to our services.

While performing quarterly regulatory and bookkeeping checks, our team found an exception related to your Profit Sharing Equity Plan. There appears to be a delay in processing your inclusion in the distribution of equity shares due to an unidentified discontinuity.

This unusual circumstance has affected your portfolio, and immediate attention is required to ensure the appropriate distribution of equity under your name. If action is not taken within 72 hours, it might result in further delays, affecting your profit share in the upcoming quarter.
