Subject: Urgent: Action Needed On Your Tuition Reimbursement

Dear Student,

I trust this email finds you in good health.

My name is Samantha Tracey, and I am the Director of Student Accounts at Quincy College. During our routine end of the month evaluation, we noticed that there is a pending action on your account regarding your tuition reimbursement from Safelite. Our records show that your tuition for the current semester is yet to be reimbursed by your employer. 

As per Safelite's policy, the tuition reimbursement funds are generally transferred directly to the college account of the employee within 60 days of the start of the semester. Our check on the account today, however, noted that we're yet to receive this reimbursement towards your tuition fees.

To ensure this doesn't affect your student account standing or next semester's registration, we urge you to take immediate action. Please contact your HR Department at Safelite to clarify this matter. 

Once you receive the confirmation from your HR, you can then update the status on your college portal linked below.

We understand that with the rigours of your job with Safelite and college, these administrative roles can be overwhelming. Hence, I have taken it upon myself to personally inform you, to avoid any last-minute inconvenience.

If you have any questions or issues, please do not hesitate to contact our office at (617) 984-1650 or reply to this email.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Regards,

Samantha Tracey
Director of Student Accounts,
Quincy College

P.S: Please complete these steps latest by the end of this week to avoid any penalties or issues with your course registration for next semester.
