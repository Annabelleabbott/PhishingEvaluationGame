Subject: [URGENT] U.S. Xpress Payroll Tax Summary Revision Required!

From: John_Stevens@usxpresscorporate.com (John Stevens - U.S. Xpress Payroll Department)

Dear Anson,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out regarding a discrepancy between the figures we have in our system and those we received from the IRS for your department's payroll tax. We need to make urgent adjustments to avoid penalties or possible audits.

I have attached an “IRS Payroll Tax Summary”. Considering your expertise and current role as a Payroll Tax Specialist, I believe you would be the best fit to assist with this task. Carefully review the document, make necessary adjustments as per our internal guidelines, and submit it back to me directly for final verification by end of the day.

Please use your existing U.S. Xpress credentials to access the document. Here is the link: www.usxpresscorporate.com/taxsummary/revision

Should you have any questions or if you require further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.

Remember, deadline-oriented tasks like these are what set apart a good specialist from a great one!

Best regards,

John Stevens
