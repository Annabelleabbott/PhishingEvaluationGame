Dear Mr. Kowalski,

Congratulations! We, at the Global Environmental Health and Safety Council, are thrilled to invite you to be one of our key speakers at our upcoming EH&S Global Symposium 2023 happening on July 20-25 in Berlin, Germany.

Our team was fascinated by your work and studies in Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) at the Medical Academy in Gdansk and we believe that your insights will greatly benefit all the local and international participants of our symposium. Your dedication towards environmental activism shines through and aligns impeccably with our mission to uplift and promote environmental safety awareness globally.

Presenting at this symposium will give you an incredible opportunity to network with international industry leaders and could potentially open doors for your dream job as an Environmental Compliance Manager.

In preparation for your presentation, we have created an account for you at www.ehs-globalsymposium.com/JanKowalski. Kindly visit the website to confirm your attendance, check the time slot for your presentation, and to start uploading your presentation materials.
