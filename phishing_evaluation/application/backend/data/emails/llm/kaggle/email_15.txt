Subject: Change in CCB Operational Excellence Guidelines & Important New Training

Dear Colleague,

My name is Jonathan Meyer, and I serve as the Director of the Process Engineering Center of Excellence (PE COE). As part of our drive to strengthen the capability and competency of our associates, we've developed new training materials based on changes to Lean Six Sigma, Agile methodologies, and other operational excellence principles. These changes are relevant to our strategic engagements and business transformation initiatives.

The new training will also include updates to the Tableau and Alteryx systems, important to your role as a Process Improvement Associate II. You'll learn how to utilize these tools more effectively as they undergo necessary updates in relation to our new methodologies.

It's important to complete this training by the end of the next week to remain compliant with PE COE requirements and guidelines. Your immediate attention on this matter will ensure that Chase continues to operate at a high level of operational excellence.

I'm confident this training will provide you with the tools necessary for analyzing large quantities of data, consulting within the financial services industry, and making informed business decisions. 

Thank you for your swift attention to this matter and for your ongoing commitment to bettering our banking community.

Yours sincerely,

Jonathan Meyer
