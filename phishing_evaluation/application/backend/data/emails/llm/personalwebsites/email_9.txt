Subject: Exciting New Collaboration Opportunity for Holly Tucker with W.W. Norton

Dear Professor Holly Tucker,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Elaine Smith and I am contacting you from W.W. Norton main office. As one of our distinguished and respected authors, we deeply value your work and the unique historical insights you provide. That’s why I am thrilled to inform you about a new project we’re putting together that appears perfectly suited for someone with your background and expertise. 

We are currently working on an anthology about notable crimes and criminals from the era of Louis XIV to the French Revolution. Your work on "City of Light, City of Poison: Murder, Magic, and the First Police Chief of Paris" has been highly recognized and we believe your contribution to this new project will add significant value to the anthology’s holistic narrative.

The aim of this project is to introduce our audience to a carefully curated collection of captivating crime stories from pre-revolutionary France. We believe your ability to make even the most complex historical narratives accessible and engaging will help us achieve this goal.

In order to discuss further details like deadlines, honorarium, and possible promotional travel, we've set up a secure portal where you can review the project proposal, and if interested, sign the initial agreement for drafting the work.
