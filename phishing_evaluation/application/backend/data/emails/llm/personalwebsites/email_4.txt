Subject: Invitation for a Keynote Speech at International Affective Computing Conference (IACC) 2024 

Dear Dr. Natasha Jaques,

My name is Dr. Helen Brandowsky, Senior Director of the International Affective Computing Conference (IACC). 

We are planning our annual conference which will be held in Singapore from June 10th to June 13th, 2024. Last year's conference hosted over 2,500 of the world's top professionals and this year we expect the conference to be an even greater success. 

We have followed your career progression and have been avidly interested in your work on Affective Computing and machine learning. Your recent article "Social Influence as Intrinsic Motivation for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" published on IEEE transactions on Affective Computing has caught great attention from our team and the critical acclaim it has received speaks volumes about its impact. 

We believe that your insights and experience would contribute greatly to our conference. With this in mind, we are honored to invite you to be a keynote speaker at our conference. The curated theme for this year's event is "Affective Computing - Rewriting Behavioral Analysis." 

Attendees can draw on your vast experience and knowledge in this constantly evolving field. We believe that you would increase the value of our conference for participants by sharing your groundbreaking work.
