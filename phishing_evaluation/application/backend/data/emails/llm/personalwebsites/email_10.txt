Subject: Need Your Opinion on Historical Crime Narrative

Dear Professor Tucker,

I trust this email finds you well. My name is Sylvie, I am a senior acquisitions editor with Les Éditions du Seuil. We specialize in the publication of top tier literary, historical nonfiction books here in France. Having read and been captivated by your recent book, 
"City of Light, City of Poison: Murder, Magic, and the First Police Chief of Paris", I am very taken with your depth of research and captivating narrative style that makes history come alive. In this spirit, I wanted to discuss an opportunity that I hope will pique your interest. We are in the early phase of curating a collection of essays on the topic of "Historical Crime Narrative in Early Modern France", focusing on the intersection between crime, culture, and power 
dynamics. Given your illustrious body of work, we strongly believe that your contribution will significantly enrich this project.

Is it possible for you to share a preliminary abstract, based on your rich knowledge of French historical crimes? I understand that you are extremely busy, but if you could spare some time for this, I believe it would be enormously beneficial to our 
readers.

You can submit the abstract through our newly developed submissions portal. The link attached below directs you to a secure site where you can upload your document. Please use your standard credentials for instant recognition:

I look forward to your positive response and potentially working with you on this exciting venture.

Warm regards,
